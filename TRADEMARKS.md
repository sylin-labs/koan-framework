Sora Trademark Guidelines (lightweight)

- “Sora” and the Sora logo are trademarks of Sylin.org.
- You may use the name "Sora" to accurately refer to this project and to describe compatibility (e.g., "Plugin for Sora"), provided that such use:
  - does not suggest sponsorship, endorsement, or official status by Sylin.org;
  - does not cause confusion about the origin of your project or product.
- Do not use the Sora name or logos in your project names, domain names, or social media handles in a way that could imply affiliation.
- Feel free to describe your project as "built with Sora" or "compatible with Sora".
- If in doubt, open an issue to ask for guidance.
