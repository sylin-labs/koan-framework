# AI in Sora

Sora provides a simple, capability-driven way to add AI features (chat, embeddings, RAG, and AI-powered transformations) with auto-setup defaults, controller-based HTTP, and strong observability.

- Start small in-app with local or hosted models.
- Scale to a sidecar or central proxy/connector with governance, budgets, and quotas.
- Choose your vector store via adapters (Redis first, then Weaviate/pgvector, etc.).

See the epic for a full roadmap and interconnected deliverables:
