# Task Definition: Koan Framework Capabilities Reference

## Objective

Create a single document source of truth for all Koan Framework capabilities that serves as a comprehensive reference for software architects, engineers, and developers.

## Scope

### Included
- **All Koan modules** in the `src/` directory (excluding samples and tests)
- **Module capabilities** and feature sets
- **Architectural patterns** and integration approaches
- **Configuration options** and customization points
- **Module relationships** and dependencies
- **Practical guidance** for implementation

### Excluded
- Sample applications (`samples/` directory)
- Test projects (`*.Tests` projects)
- Infrastructure and build tooling

## Requirements

### Content Requirements
1. **Module Mapping**
   - Complete inventory of all Koan modules
   - Categorization by functionality (Core, Data, Web, AI, etc.)
   - Dependency relationships between modules

2. **Deep Analysis**
   - Architecture and design patterns used
   - Key interfaces and abstractions
   - Configuration systems and options
   - Extension points and customization
   - Integration with ASP.NET Core and .NET ecosystem

3. **Capability Documentation**
   - What each module does (purpose and role)
   - How modules work together (integration patterns)
   - When to use each module (use cases and scenarios)
   - Configuration and setup requirements

### Audience Requirements
- **Software Architects**: Need high-level understanding of capabilities and architectural patterns
- **Engineers**: Need integration approaches and technical implementation details
- **Developers**: Need practical usage, configuration examples, and guidance

### Quality Requirements
- **Clear Language**: Accessible to readers with varying Koan experience
- **Progressive Knowledge Building**: Start with basics, build to advanced concepts
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All modules documented with consistent depth
- **Practical Focus**: Include real-world usage scenarios and examples

## Success Criteria

1. **Complete Module Coverage**: All Koan modules analyzed and documented
2. **Architectural Clarity**: Clear explanation of how modules fit in the overall framework
3. **Practical Utility**: Document serves as effective reference for implementation decisions
4. **Knowledge Progression**: Readers can understand concepts regardless of starting knowledge

## Deliverables

1. **Module Discovery Report** (`module-discovery.md`)
   - Complete inventory of all Koan modules
   - Categorization and dependency mapping

2. **Analysis Notes** (`analysis-notes/`)
   - Detailed findings for each module
   - Architecture patterns and design decisions
   - Key interfaces and extension points

3. **Comprehensive Reference** (`koan-capabilities-reference.md`)
   - Unified documentation covering all modules
   - Structured for different audience needs
   - Practical guidance and examples

## Timeline Considerations

This is a comprehensive analysis task that may span multiple sessions. The folder structure and intermediate documents ensure continuity across sessions and enable incremental progress.
