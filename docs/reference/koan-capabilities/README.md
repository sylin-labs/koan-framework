# Koan Framework Capabilities Reference

## Project Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive reference documentation for all Koan Framework capabilities. The target audience includes software architects, engineers, and developers who need to understand the framework's modules, their roles, and capabilities.

## Objectives

1. **Map all Koan modules** (excluding samples and tests) with deep analysis
2. **Document module architecture** and feature sets
3. **Explain module relationships** and integration patterns
4. **Provide capability reference** for software architects
5. **Build knowledge progressively** to help readers understand concepts

## Structure

- `task-definition.md` - Detailed task requirements and scope
- `module-discovery.md` - Complete mapping of all Koan modules
- `analysis-notes/` - Deep analysis findings for each module
- `koan-capabilities-reference.md` - Final comprehensive reference document

## Approach

### Phase 1: Discovery
- Scan entire codebase for Koan modules
- Categorize modules by functionality
- Document module dependencies and relationships

### Phase 2: Analysis
- Deep dive into each module's architecture
- Document capabilities, features, and configuration options
- Identify integration patterns and best practices

### Phase 3: Documentation
- Create unified reference document
- Structure information for different reader personas
- Include practical examples and guidance

## Target Audience

- **Software Architects**: High-level capabilities and architectural patterns
- **Engineers**: Integration approaches and technical implementation
- **Developers**: Practical usage, configuration, and examples

The documentation builds knowledge progressively, ensuring readers can understand concepts regardless of their starting familiarity with the framework.
