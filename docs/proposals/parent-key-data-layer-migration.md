# RFC: Migrate ParentKey Functionality from Sora.Flow to Sora.Data

**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** Framework Team  
**Date:** 2024-09-12  
**Priority:** High  

## Executive Summary

This proposal recommends migrating the ParentKey functionality from `Sora.Flow.Core` to `Sora.Data.Core` to enable cross-module parent-child relationship support. This architectural change will unlock GraphQL-like relationship querying in REST APIs, improve framework consistency, and reduce coupling between modules.

## Current State Analysis

### ParentKey in Sora.Flow

Currently, ParentKey functionality is tightly coupled to Flow-specific concepts:

- **Location**: `src/Sora.Flow.Core/Attributes/FlowAttributes.cs:44`
- **Dependencies**: FlowEntity, FlowValueObject, IdentityLink, FlowSets, FlowRegistry
- **Resolution Service**: `ParentKeyResolutionService` handles deferred parent resolution
- **Usage**: 37+ files across Flow module, 3 sample implementations

```csharp
// Current implementation
[ParentKey(parent: typeof(Sensor), payloadPath: "SensorId")]
public string SensorId { get; set; } = string.Empty;
```

### Limitations

1. **Module Isolation**: Only Flow entities can use parent-child relationships
2. **Code Duplication**: Other modules must implement custom relationship patterns  
3. **Inconsistent APIs**: No unified approach to relationship loading across modules
4. **Limited Querying**: No support for relationship inclusion in REST endpoints

## Proposed Architecture

### New Abstractions in Sora.Data.Core

```csharp
// Core relationship attribute
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Property)]
public class EntityReferenceAttribute : Attribute
{
    public Type ParentType { get; }
    public string? Role { get; }
    public string? ExternalKeyPath { get; }
    
    public EntityReferenceAttribute(Type parentType, string? role = null, string? externalKeyPath = null)
    {
        ParentType = parentType ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(parentType));
        Role = string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(role) ? null : role;
        ExternalKeyPath = string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(externalKeyPath) ? null : externalKeyPath;
    }
}

// Relationship resolution abstraction
public interface IRelationshipResolver
{
    Task<TKey?> ResolveParentKeyAsync<TParent, TKey>(
        string externalKey, 
        string sourceSystem, 
        CancellationToken ct = default) where TParent : IEntity<TKey>;
        
    Task<IReadOnlyList<TChild>> GetChildrenAsync<TChild, TKey>(
        TKey parentId, 
        CancellationToken ct = default) where TChild : class, IEntity<TKey>;
        
    Task<TParent?> GetParentAsync<TParent, TKey>(
        TKey childId, 
        CancellationToken ct = default) where TParent : class, IEntity<TKey>;
}

// Enhanced Entity base class
public abstract class Entity<TEntity, TKey> : IEntity<TKey>
    where TEntity : class, IEntity<TKey>
    where TKey : notnull
{
    // Existing functionality...
    
    // New relationship methods
    public static Task<TParent?> GetParent<TParent>(TKey childId, CancellationToken ct = default)
        where TParent : class, IEntity<TKey>
        => Data<TEntity, TKey>.Relationships.GetParent<TParent>(childId, ct);
    
    public static Task<IReadOnlyList<TChild>> GetChildren<TChild>(TKey parentId, CancellationToken ct = default)
        where TChild : class, IEntity<TKey>
        => Data<TEntity, TKey>.Relationships.GetChildren<TChild>(parentId, ct);
}
```

### Relationship Registry

```csharp
public interface IRelationshipRegistry
{
    void RegisterRelationship<TEntity, TParent, TKey>(
        Expression<Func<TEntity, TKey>> foreignKey,
        string? role = null) 
        where TEntity : class, IEntity<TKey>
        where TParent : class, IEntity<TKey>;
        
    RelationshipInfo? GetRelationship<TEntity>(string relationshipName);
    IEnumerable<RelationshipInfo> GetRelationships<TEntity>();
}

public record RelationshipInfo(
    Type EntityType,
    Type RelatedType, 
    string PropertyName,
    string? Role,
    RelationshipCardinality Cardinality);
```

# With customer information
GET /api/orders/123?with=customer

# With multiple relationships
GET /api/orders/123?with=customer,items,shipping

# Collection with relationships
GET /api/customers?with=orders&filter={"active":true}
```

#### Response Structure
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "total": 299.99,
  "status": "shipped",
  "customer": {
    "id": "456", 
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
