# Koan Framework API

Welcome to the Koan Framework API reference. This site includes:

- Reference docs generated from C# XML comments (see Reference).
- A map of assemblies and what they provide (Core, Data, Messaging, Web).
- HTTP API conventions (endpoints, filtering, paging headers, well-known routes).
- Instructions to generate OpenAPI specs for your Koan-based APIs.

Start here:
- Assemblies — high-level map of packages and namespaces
- HTTP API — endpoint conventions and headers
- Well-known endpoints — capabilities and observability
- Reference — auto-generated types and members
