# Sora API Docs

This folder contains generated API reference content from XML documentation comments.

## Reference content

Doc site generation has been removed from this repo. The `docs/api` folder now contains hand-authored reference pages only. XML documentation remains enabled in the solution via `Directory.Build.props` for IDE tooltips and NuGet packaging.
