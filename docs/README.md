# Sora Docs

This is the documentation root. Navigation is organized by domain pillars for clarity and growth:

- Engineering (front door)
  - High-signal rules and quick links — see engineering/index.md
- Architecture Principles
  - Curated ADR digest — see architecture/principles.md

- Guides (concepts)
  - Core: hosting, options, composition — see guides/core/
  - Data: repositories, filters, instructions, sets — see guides/data/
  - Web: controllers, transformers, health — see guides/web/
  - Messaging: buses, handlers, provisioning — see guides/messaging/
  - Adapters: Sqlite, SqlServer, Postgres, Mongo, Json — see guides/adapters/
- Support: environment, troubleshooting, CI/CD, security
- Decisions (ADRs): grouped by topic (ARCH, DATA, WEB, MESS, OPS, DX)
- API: generated reference

See toc.yml for the structured nav. Each folder has an index.md to orient and deep-link.
