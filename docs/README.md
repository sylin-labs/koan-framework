# Sora Docs

This is the documentation root. Navigation is organized by domain pillars for clarity and growth:

- Guides (concepts + how-to)
  - Core: hosting, options, composition
  - Data: repositories, filters, instructions, sets
  - Web: controllers, transformers, health
  - Messaging: buses, handlers, provisioning
  - Adapters: Sqlite, SqlServer, Postgres, Mongo, Json
- Support: environment, troubleshooting, CI/CD, security
- Decisions (ADRs): grouped by topic (ARCH, DATA, WEB, MESS, OPS, DX)
- API: generated reference

See toc.yml for the structured nav. Each folder has an index.md to orient and deep-link.
