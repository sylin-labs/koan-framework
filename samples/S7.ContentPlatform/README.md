# S7.ContentPlatform - Content Management Sample

This sample demonstrates a **Content Management Platform** for blog/publishing workflows, showcasing Sora's **moderation** and **soft-delete** capabilities in a real-world scenario.

## üéØ What This Sample Demonstrates

### 1. **Moderation Workflow**
- **Draft ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Published** article lifecycle
- Editorial approval/rejection with feedback
- Articles move between different "sets" based on status
- Moderation endpoints via generic capability controllers

### 2. **Soft-Delete Capabilities**  
- Archive published articles without permanent data loss
- Recovery of "deleted" content for compliance/audit
- Separate "deleted" set maintains data integrity

### 3. **Real-World Content Platform Features**
- Multi-role author system (Writer, Editor, Admin)
- Category-based article organization
- Rich article metadata (tags, reading time, SEO slugs)
- Publication statistics and analytics

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Models
- **`Article`** - Core content entity with workflow status
- **`Author`** - Writer/editor profiles with role-based permissions  
- **`Category`** - Content organization and theming

### Controllers
- **`ArticlesController`** - Core CRUD + workflow actions
- **`AuthorsController`** - Author management + statistics
- **`CategoriesController`** - Category management + analytics
- **Generic Capability Controllers** - Auto-registered for moderation/soft-delete

### Data Sets
- **Default set** - Published articles and active content
- **`moderation` set** - Articles under editorial review
- **`deleted` set** - Soft-deleted/archived content
- **`audit` set** - Historical snapshots (via audit controller)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   cd samples/S7.ContentPlatform
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Open Swagger UI:** `https://localhost:5001/swagger`

3. **Explore the seeded data:**
   - Seeding is done automatically by a single scheduled bootstrap task (runs once on startup)
   - 4 sample authors (including editor role)
   - 3 content categories  
   - 6 articles in various states
   - Articles in moderation workflow
   - Soft-deleted content examples

## üìã Key Workflows to Explore

### Editorial Workflow (canonical routes)
1. Create/Update Draft:
   - `POST /api/articles/{id}/moderation/draft`
   - `PATCH /api/articles/{id}/moderation/draft`
2. Submit/Withdraw:
   - `POST /api/articles/{id}/moderation/submit`
   - `POST /api/articles/{id}/moderation/withdraw`
3. Review Queue: `GET /api/articles/moderation/queue`
4. Approve/Reject/Return:
   - `POST /api/articles/{id}/moderation/approve`
   - `POST /api/articles/{id}/moderation/reject`
   - `POST /api/articles/{id}/moderation/return`

### Soft-Delete Operations
1. **Soft Delete (single):** `POST /api/articles/{id}/soft-delete`
   - Moves article to "deleted" set
   - Keeps data for potential recovery

2. **List Deleted:** `GET /api/articles/soft-delete/deleted`
   - Shows all soft-deleted articles
   - Available for recovery/audit

3. **Restore (single):** `POST /api/articles/{id}/soft-delete/restore`
   
Bulk operations:
- Soft delete many: `POST /api/articles/soft-delete`
- Restore many: `POST /api/articles/soft-delete/restore`
   - Moves article back to main set
   - Restores full functionality

### Audit Trail
1. **Create Snapshot:** `POST /api/articles/{id}/audit/snapshot`
   - Saves versioned copy to audit set
   - Tracks content changes over time

2. **View History:** `GET /api/articles/{id}/audit`
   - Lists all snapshots for an article
   - Shows editorial/content evolution

## üéÆ Sample API Calls

### Get Published Articles
```bash
GET /api/articles/published
# Returns only published articles, sorted by publish date
```

### Review Queue (Moderation)
```bash
GET /api/articles/moderation/queue
# Lists articles awaiting editorial review
```
 
### Approve Article
```bash
POST /api/articles/moderation/blockchain-explained/approve
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "note": "Great content! Publishing to tech section.",
   "transform": null
}
```

### Soft Delete Article (single)
```bash
POST /api/articles/outdated-tech-guide/soft-delete
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "note": "Archived due to obsolete information"
}
```

### Author Statistics
```bash
GET /api/authors/alice/stats
# Shows publication metrics for author
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The sample uses:
- **JSON file storage** for simplicity (via `Sora.Data.Json`)
- **In-memory data** with seeded examples
- **Generic capability controllers** for moderation/soft-delete
- **Swagger documentation** for API exploration

### Key Dependencies
```xml
