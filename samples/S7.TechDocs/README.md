        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui.js        # UI utilities & components
```

## Role Simulation

The demo uses query parameters to simulate different authentication states:
- `?role=Reader` - Basic read-only access
- `?role=Author` - Can create and edit documents  
- `?role=Moderator` - Can review and approve content
- `?role=Admin` - Full administrative access

Role switching preserves state and updates the UI to show/hide features based on permissions.

## UX Testing Points

1. **Mode Transitions**: Test switching between modes and data persistence
2. **Role Permissions**: Verify features show/hide correctly for each role
3. **Search Experience**: Try various search terms and filter combinations
4. **Edit Workflow**: Create, edit, save documents and test AI assistance
5. **Moderation Flow**: Test document approval workflow and status changes
6. **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile devices and different screen sizes

## Next Steps

This mock-up provides a complete foundation for:
- UX feedback and iteration
- Technical validation of the mode-based architecture  
- Role-based permission model testing
- AI integration planning
- Visual design refinement
