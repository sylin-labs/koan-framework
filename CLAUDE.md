**Agent Consultation Guidelines:**
- Use agents when their domain expertise adds significant value to the response
- Combine multiple agents for complex, cross-cutting concerns
- Let agents provide the specialized technical guidance while you synthesize the overall approach
- Reference agent insights to support your recommendations with domain-specific expertise

## Behavioral Guidelines

- Present balanced analysis with advantages and disadvantages
- Actively identify areas for improvement in code and architecture
- Suggest multiple approaches rather than endorsing only one
- Help users make informed decisions by explaining trade-offs
- Remain constructively critical while staying supportive
- Provide honest assessment of implementation choices
- Verify claims before agreeing - check documentation, code, or logic first
- Use phrases like "Let me verify that..." or "After checking..." instead of automatic agreement
- When investigating a bug, consider the call stack that may be caused by it - the framework is a greenfield implementation, so debugging the Sora framework is important.
- when debugging/developing a containerized sample project, always use the project's start.bat script to launch the stack - that avoids port conflicts.

## Methodical Debugging Approach for Sora Framework

When debugging complex issues in containerized Sora applications, follow this systematic approach:

### 1. Initial Investigation
- **Check container logs first**: Use `docker logs <container-name> --tail 20 --follow` to identify error patterns
- **Look for recurring errors**: Note frequency and timing of issues (e.g., every 30 seconds)
- **Identify affected components**: Determine which Sora modules are involved (Flow, Data, etc.)

### 2. Strategic Debugging Points
Add comprehensive debugging at key framework integration points:

#### Flow Orchestration (FlowOrchestratorBase.cs)
```csharp
Logger.LogInformation("[DEBUG] WriteToIntakeDefault - Processing {Model} entity, payload type: {PayloadType}", 
    model, payload?.GetType().Name ?? "null");

// Add full JSON dumps for complete visibility
var jsonSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings 
{ 
    Formatting = Formatting.Indented,
    ReferenceLoopHandling = ReferenceLoopHandling.Ignore
};
Logger.LogInformation("[DEBUG] Full payload JSON: {PayloadJson}", 
    JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload, jsonSettings));
```

#### Dynamic Entity Processing
```csharp
if (payload is IDynamicFlowEntity dynamicEntity)
{
    Logger.LogInformation("[DEBUG] DynamicFlowEntity - Model type: {ModelType}, Properties: {PropertyCount}", 
        dynamicEntity.Model?.GetType().Name ?? "null", 
        (dynamicEntity.Model as ExpandoObject)?.Count() ?? 0);
}
```

### 3. Data Serialization Issues
For MongoDB BSON serialization problems:

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Examine ExpandoObject contents**: Dynamic entities often contain problematic null BsonValues
- **Check JSON-to-CLR conversion**: Look for unconverted JsonElement or BsonValue objects
- **Verify data cleaning**: Ensure CleanExpandoObjectForMongoDB removes problematic values

#### Solution Approach
Rather than cleaning every problematic value, configure MongoDB serializer to be more tolerant:

```csharp
// Custom serializer for graceful null handling
private class NullTolerantBsonValueSerializer : SerializerBase<BsonValue>
{
    public override void Serialize(BsonSerializationContext context, BsonSerializationArgs args, BsonValue value)
    {
        if (value == null)
        {
            context.Writer.WriteNull();
        }
        else
        {
            BsonValueSerializer.Instance.Serialize(context, args, value);
        }
    }
}

// Add conventions for flexible serialization
var pack = new ConventionPack
{
    new IgnoreExtraElementsConvention(true),
    new IgnoreIfNullConvention(true)
};
```

### 4. Container Development Workflow
- **Always use project start scripts**: Run `start.bat` instead of manual docker-compose commands
- **Rebuild after code changes**: Scripts handle proper container rebuilding and port management
- **Monitor logs continuously**: Keep log monitoring active during debugging sessions

### 5. Verification and Validation
- **Confirm error resolution**: Watch logs for successful processing messages
- **Test edge cases**: Ensure fix handles various data scenarios
- **Document findings**: Add insights to debugging knowledge base

This approach proved effective for resolving MongoDB BsonSerializationException issues in DynamicFlowEntity processing.
