  - Framework Specialist validation: **PASSED**

### Infrastructure
- ✅ **Main README.md** - New documentation index with role-based navigation
- ✅ **VALIDATION-FRAMEWORK.md** - Comprehensive validation standards and processes
- ✅ **Document templates** - Standardized frontmatter and validation requirements
- ✅ **Directory structure** - Created all primary documentation folders

### Architecture Decision Records
- ✅ **decisions/** - Direct migration completed (ADRs exempt from validation per framework)
  - 113 ADR files copied with existing structure preserved
  - Index and navigation maintained
  - Template and standards preserved

## Phase 2: Reference and Guides ✅ COMPLETED

### Reference Migration ✅
- ✅ **reference/core/index.md** - Core pillar with auto-registration, health checks, config patterns
- ✅ **reference/data/index.md** - Entity patterns, relationships, vector search, multi-provider support
- ✅ **reference/web/index.md** - Controllers, authentication, transformers, security features
- ✅ **reference/ai/index.md** - AI integration, chat completion, vector search, RAG patterns
- ✅ **reference/flow/index.md** - Data pipeline, ingestion, keying, association, projection stages
- ✅ **reference/messaging/index.md** - Commands, announcements, flow events, batching, retries
- ✅ **reference/storage/index.md** - File/blob storage, profiles, routing, pipeline steps
- ✅ **reference/orchestration/index.md** - DevHost CLI, container orchestration, deployment artifacts

### Guide Migration ✅
- ✅ **guides/building-apis.md** - REST endpoints, business logic, validation, file uploads, testing
- ✅ **guides/data-modeling.md** - Entity design, relationships, business logic, events, validation
- ✅ **guides/authentication-setup.md** - Multi-provider auth with local dev and production patterns
- ✅ **guides/performance.md** - Data access optimization, memory management, async patterns
- ✅ **guides/ai-integration.md** - Chat completion, vector search, RAG implementation

### Applied Minimalistic Standards ✅
- **Removed unnecessary boilerplate** - No DataAdapter attributes when only one provider present
- **Eliminated marketing language** - Focus on practical examples over descriptive text
- **Showed magic through examples** - Clean code that demonstrates capabilities directly
- **Progressive complexity** - Simple examples building to advanced patterns
- **Validated patterns** - All examples follow current framework conventions

## Phase 3: Architecture and Support ✅ COMPLETED

### Architecture Content ✅
- ✅ **architecture/principles.md** - Core design philosophy, framework patterns, container-native principles

### Support Content ✅
- ✅ **support/troubleshooting.md** - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide covering all pillars

## Validation Standards Applied

### Technical Correctness ✅
- All code examples compile with current framework version
- Proper namespace imports validated by Framework Specialist
- API references verified against current implementation
- Configuration examples tested for validity

### Framework Compliance ✅
- Entity patterns follow established conventions
- Controller inheritance uses correct base classes
- Auto-registration patterns properly demonstrated
- Health check endpoints correctly documented

### Quality Standards ✅
- Consistent frontmatter with validation tracking
- Progressive complexity from simple to advanced
- Clear prerequisites and dependencies
- Proper cross-references and navigation

## Metrics

### Content Volume
